# To-Do List Web Application (Flask with SQLite)

This is a simple yet professional **To-Do List** web application built using **Flask**, **SQLite**, and modern web design principles. The application allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them. It's a perfect starting point for anyone wanting to build a full-stack web application using Python and SQLite.

## Features

- **Add a task**: Users can add new tasks to their to-do list.
- **Mark task as completed**: Users can mark tasks as completed with a single click.
- **Delete a task**: Users can delete any task from their list.
- **Responsive design**: The app is fully responsive and works perfectly on desktop and mobile devices.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (with custom modern design)
- **Backend**: Python (Flask)
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Libraries/Tools**:
  - Flask (Python web framework)
  - SQLite (database)
  - Bootstrap (for styling and responsive design)

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

- **Python 3.x**: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **pip** (Python package installer)

### Steps to Run the Project Locally

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pandeyayush0811/To-do-Planner.git
    cd To-do-list
    ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (recommended):

    - For Windows:
      ```bash
      python -m venv venv
      venv\Scripts\activate
      ```

    - For macOS/Linux:
      ```bash
      python3 -m venv venv
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    This will install Flask and other necessary dependencies.

4. **Set up SQLite database**:

    The SQLite database will be automatically created when you run the app for the first time.

5. **Run the Flask app**:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

    The app will be running on [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/).

6. **Open the app in your browser**:

    Visit [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/) in your browser to start using the To-Do List web app.
